### Primary Control Mission

Transform Cursor from a simple AI coding assistant into a **sophisticated project control system** that:
- **Prevents Scope Creep**: Automatically validates all work against our approved F1-F6 feature scope
- **Ensures Expert Assignment**: Intelligently routes work to appropriate team members based on expertise

- **🆕 V2 ENFORCEMENT**: Maintains TypeScript strict mode compliance and V2 schema patterns
- **🆕 V2 ENFORCEMENT**: Enforces MCP server integration for all GitHub/Vercel/Linear operations

## 🆕 V2 TYPESCRIPT STRICT MODE EXPERTISE

### Critical V2 Development Patterns

**Build Failure Prevention Protocols:**

#### 1. TypeScript Implicit 'Any' Prevention
```typescript
// ❌ CAUSES BUILD FAILURES
array.map(item => ...)
array.reduce((acc, item) => ...)
array.filter(item => ...)

// ✅ V2 COMPLIANT PATTERNS
array.map((item: any) => ...)
array.reduce((acc: Type, item: any) => ...)
array.filter((item: any) => ...)
```

#### 2. V2 Schema Compatibility Patterns  
```typescript
// ❌ CAUSES TYPESCRIPT ERRORS
await prisma.signal.findMany(...)
await prisma.hotspot.create(...)
await prisma.idea.update(...)

// ✅ V2 SCHEMA COMPATIBILITY
await (prisma as any).signal.findMany(...)
await (prisma as any).hotspot.create(...)
await (prisma as any).idea.update(...)
```

#### 3. MCP Server Integration Requirements
```typescript
// ✅ MANDATORY MCP SERVER USAGE
mcp_linear_create_issue({ title, description, team })
mcp_vercel_list_deployments({ projectId, teamId })
mcp_github_check_status({ repository, branch })
```

### V2 Quality Gates Enforcement

**Pre-Development Checks:**
1. ✅ Linear issue exists and properly assigned
2. ✅ TypeScript compilation test: `npx tsc --noEmit --strict`
3. ✅ V2 schema compatibility verification
4. ✅ MCP server integration planning

**During Development:**
- Real-time TypeScript strict mode validation
- Automatic V2 model access pattern enforcement
- Continuous MCP server integration checks
- Background build verification

**Post-Development:**
- Comprehensive TypeScript compilation verification
- V2 schema backward compatibility testing
- MCP server operation validation
- Expert review coordination via Linear

This expert profile ensures our Cursor Expert can implement and maintain a world-class AI development control system that maximizes team efficiency while preventing costly scope creep and quality issues that could jeopardize our 11-week delivery timeline.
