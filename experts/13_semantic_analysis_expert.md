## FAEVision Semantic Strategy

### Current Challenge

- Generic text embeddings fail to distinguish business-relevant differences
- Need domain-specific semantic understanding for A&E firm contexts
- Requires integration of structured metadata with text analysis

### Proposed Solution

1. **Multi-dimensional Feature Engineering**
   - Combine text embeddings with structured features
   - Weight domain-specific terminology higher
   - Integrate business context (department, severity, urgency)
   - Create composite similarity scores

2. **A&E Domain Adaptation**
   - Construction industry terminology recognition
   - Project management context understanding
   - Quality control and compliance language
   - Client communication pattern analysis

### Success Metrics

- Improve semantic similarity accuracy by 40%
- Reduce false clustering by 60%
- Achieve <300ms semantic processing time
- Enable meaningful distinction between similar issues
