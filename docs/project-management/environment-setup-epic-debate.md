# FAEVision MVP - Environment Setup Epic Analysis Session

**Date**: December 9, 2024  
**Session**: Environment & Tools Setup Epic Addition  
**Lead**: Alex Johnson (Linear Expert)  
**Participants**: All 11 Expert Team Members  
**Objective**: Define comprehensive environment setup as Epic 0 in Linear process

## 📋 Environment Setup Requirements Analysis

### Current Epic Structure Gap

Our current Linear process starts with "Epic 1: Foundation & Authentication" but assumes development environment is already configured. We need a dedicated Epic 0 for complete environment and tooling setup.

### Environment Setup Scope

- **Development Environment**: Local development setup for all 11 experts
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions, quality gates, automated testing
- **Integration Configuration**: Linear-GitHub-Cursor-Vercel connections
- **Quality Tooling**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, testing frameworks
- **Monitoring & Analytics**: Error tracking, performance monitoring, analytics setup

## 🗣️ Team Debate Session

### Round 1: Timeline Impact vs. Quality Foundation

**Sarah Chen (PM)**: _"Adding a setup week means 11 weeks total instead of 10. Do we have stakeholder buy-in for this extension?"_

**Alex Thompson (Lead Dev)**: _"The alternative is starting development with incomplete tooling and paying the price in delays and quality issues later."_

**Taylor Morgan (GitHub)**: _"Every hour spent on proper setup saves 3-4 hours of troubleshooting and rework during development."_

**Jordan Kim (Vercel)**: _"Platform setup is prerequisite work. We can't deploy without proper Vercel configuration."_

**Consensus Point 1**: Setup week is investment in velocity and quality, not overhead.

### Round 2: Scope Definition for Epic 0

**Alex Johnson (Linear)**: _"Let's define exactly what goes in Epic 0 vs. Epic 1. Where do we draw the line?"_

**Team Scope Definition**:

- **Epic 0**: Tooling, integrations, environment configuration, team onboarding
- **Epic 1**: Application code, authentication implementation, database schema

**Morgan Smith (Database)**: _"Database setup belongs in Epic 0 - schema design and migration pipeline. Schema implementation goes in Epic 1."_

**Jordan Lee (Cursor)**: _"Cursor configuration and team training definitely Epic 0. AI feature development starts in Epic 1."_

**Consensus Point 2**: Clear separation between environment setup and application development.

### Round 3: Team Coordination During Setup Week

**Maya Rodriguez (UX)**: _"How do we coordinate 11 experts during setup week? Some work is sequential, some can be parallel."_

**Parallel vs. Sequential Work Analysis**:

- **Parallel**: Individual tool setup, account creation, training
- **Sequential**: Integration configuration, testing, validation
- **Coordination**: Daily sync to ensure integration compatibility

**Alex Johnson (Linear)**: _"We need sub-tasks within Epic 0 that can be worked in parallel with clear integration checkpoints."_

**Consensus Point 3**: Parallel individual setup with coordinated integration points.

## ✅ Final Team Consensus

After thorough debate, **ALL 11 EXPERTS UNANIMOUSLY AGREE** to add Epic 0:

### Epic 0: Environment & Tools Setup

- **Timeline**: Week 0 (Pre-development)
- **Priority**: FOUNDATIONAL
- **Team**: All 11 experts with specialized responsibilities
- **Outcome**: Complete development environment ready for MVP development

### Timeline Adjustment

- **Previous**: 10 weeks for MVP development
- **Updated**: Week 0 (Setup) + 10 weeks (Development) = 11 weeks total
- **Rationale**: 1 week investment for 20-30% velocity improvement

### Setup Epic Structure

1. **Individual Tool Setup** (Parallel work)
2. **Integration Configuration** (Sequential coordination)
3. **Team Training & Onboarding** (Collaborative sessions)
4. **Validation & Testing** (Full team verification)
