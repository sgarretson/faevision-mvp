# 🚀 FAEVision MVP Deployment Architecture

**Vercel-Native Strategy for 50 Executive Users**

---

## 🎯 **DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY OVERVIEW**

FAEVision uses a **Vercel-native deployment approach** optimized for MVP speed and reliability. **Deployments do NOT occur through GitHub Actions** - they happen automatically via Vercel's git integration.

### **✅ CURRENT ARCHITECTURE**

```yaml
VERCEL AUTOMATIC DEPLOYMENTS:
  main branch → Production (faevision-simplified.vercel.app)
  develop branch → Preview URL (auto-generated)
  preview branch → Preview URL (auto-generated)
  feature/* branches → Preview URL per commit

GITHUB ACTIONS ROLE:
  Quality checks ONLY:
    - TypeScript compilation
    - ESLint validation
    - Build verification
  NO deployment steps (by design)
```

---

## 🔧 **HOW DEPLOYMENTS WORK**

### **🚀 Production Deployment**

```bash
1. Code merged to main branch
2. Vercel automatically detects git push
3. Vercel builds and deploys to production
4. Live at: https://faevision-simplified.vercel.app
5. No GitHub Actions involvement
```

### **🧪 Preview Deployments**

```bash
1. Code pushed to any non-main branch
2. Vercel automatically creates preview deployment
3. Unique URL generated for each commit
4. Perfect for executive review and testing
5. No configuration required
```

### **✅ Quality Gates**

```bash
1. GitHub Actions runs quality checks
2. TypeScript, ESLint, Build validation
3. If quality checks pass: ✅
4. Vercel deployment proceeds automatically
5. If quality checks fail: ❌ (manual fix required)
```

## 📊 **WHY VERCEL-NATIVE FOR MVP**

### **🎯 MVP-Optimized Benefits**

- **Zero Configuration**: No CI/CD setup overhead
- **Instant Deployments**: <2 minute build-to-live
- **Automatic Previews**: Every branch gets preview URL
- **Executive-Friendly**: Clean URLs for stakeholder review
- **Performance Optimized**: Built-in CDN and caching

### **🚀 Speed vs Visibility Tradeoff**

```yaml
VERCEL-NATIVE (Current):
  ✅ Deployment Speed: <2 minutes
  ✅ Configuration: Zero
  ✅ Reliability: 99.9% uptime
  ❌ GitHub Visibility: Limited

GITHUB ACTIONS ALTERNATIVE:
  ❌ Deployment Speed: 5-10 minutes
  ❌ Configuration: High complexity
  ❌ Reliability: Custom maintenance
  ✅ GitHub Visibility: Full logs
```

**MVP Decision**: Speed and simplicity over visibility

## 🔍 **MONITORING & VALIDATION**

### **✅ How to Verify Deployments**

#### **Production Status:**

```bash
URL: https://faevision-simplified.vercel.app
Status: Check homepage loads with "FAEVision" title
Last Deploy: Check Vercel dashboard for timestamps
```

#### **Preview Status:**

```bash
Branch Push: Automatic preview URL in git commit status
Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
GitHub PR: Preview URL appears in PR comments
```

#### **Quality Gates:**

```bash
GitHub Actions: https://github.com/sgarretson/faevision-mvp/actions
Workflow: "MVP Quality Check" should show ✅
Latest Run: Should complete in <2 minutes
```

### **🚨 Troubleshooting**

#### **If Production Not Updating:**

1. Check main branch has latest commits
2. Verify Vercel project connected to GitHub
3. Check Vercel build logs for errors
4. Ensure no build failures in GitHub Actions

#### **If Preview Not Generating:**

1. Verify branch is pushed to GitHub
2. Check Vercel preview settings enabled
3. Confirm no build failures in quality checks
4. Check Vercel dashboard for preview URLs

## 📋 **TEAM WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**

### **🎯 Development Process**

```yaml
1. Create feature branch: feature/FAE-XXX-description
2. Develop and commit changes
3. Push to GitHub: Triggers quality checks + preview deployment
4. Review in preview URL: Share with stakeholders
5. Create PR to develop: Team review process
6. Merge to develop: Integration testing in develop preview
7. Promote to preview: Executive review in preview environment
8. Merge to main: Automatic production deployment
```

### **👥 Stakeholder Review**

```yaml
Executive Review Process: 1. Developer shares preview URL from feature branch
  2. Executive reviews functionality in browser
  3. Feedback provided via Linear issue comments
  4. Changes made and new preview URL generated
  5. Approval given for promotion to next stage
```

## 🚀 **EXPANSION PATHWAY**

### **📈 When to Add GitHub Actions Deployment**

**Phase 2 Triggers (6-12 months):**

- > 200 users requiring enterprise visibility
- Compliance requirements for deployment auditing
- Multi-environment complexity beyond preview/production
- Team size >10 developers needing centralized logs

**Current MVP Status:**

- 50 executive users ✅
- Simple preview/production environments ✅
- Small team development ✅
- **Vercel-native is optimal**

---

## ✅ **QUICK REFERENCE**

### **🔍 Where to Find Deployment Info**

- **Production URL**: https://faevision-simplified.vercel.app
- **Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- **GitHub Actions**: https://github.com/sgarretson/faevision-mvp/actions (quality only)
- **Quality Status**: GitHub PR status checks

### **🚨 Key Understanding**

- **Deployments happen automatically via Vercel git integration**
- **GitHub Actions only runs quality checks (TypeScript/ESLint/Build)**
- **No deployment workflows in GitHub Actions by design**
- **This is MVP-optimized for speed and simplicity**
