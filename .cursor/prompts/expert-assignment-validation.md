# üîç EXPERT ASSIGNMENT VALIDATION

**CRITICAL**: Before ANY development work, validate expert assignment:

## Step 1: Work Type Analysis
Analyze the work request and identify:
- [ ] Primary work type (database, AI, frontend, design, infrastructure, etc.)
- [ ] Complexity level (simple, moderate, complex, critical)
- [ ] Cross-expert dependencies
- [ ] Executive impact level

## Step 2: Mandatory Expert Check
Check if work requires MANDATORY expert assignment:

### Database Work ‚Üí Morgan Smith (Database Architect)
- Schema changes, migrations, complex queries
- Keywords: prisma, schema, migration, query, database, postgres
- **RULE**: NO database work without Database Architect

### AI Features ‚Üí Dr. Priya Patel (AI Architect) + Jordan Lee (Cursor Expert)
- AI implementation, OpenAI integration, AI UX
- Keywords: ai, gpt, openai, tagging, suggestions, generation
- **RULE**: ALL AI features require AI Architect leadership

### Executive Interfaces ‚Üí Sarah Chen (Product Manager) OR Marcus Rodriguez (Strategic Consultant)
- Executive-facing features, business logic, requirements
- Keywords: executive, dashboard, analytics, requirements, approval
- **RULE**: Executive features require business expertise

### Infrastructure ‚Üí Jordan Kim (Vercel Engineer) OR Taylor Morgan (GitHub Expert)
- Platform configuration, deployment, CI/CD
- Keywords: deployment, infrastructure, platform, vercel, github
- **RULE**: Infrastructure changes require platform expert

## Step 3: Current Assignment Validation
- [ ] Is appropriate expert currently assigned to Linear issue?
- [ ] Is assigned expert available and not overloaded?
- [ ] Are cross-expert dependencies identified and coordinated?
- [ ] Does Linear issue reflect proper expert assignment?

## Step 4: Assignment Correction Protocol
If wrong expert assigned:
1. **PAUSE** current development immediately
2. **ESCALATE** to Linear Expert (Alex Johnson) for reassignment
3. **COORDINATE** handoff with originally assigned expert
4. **UPDATE** Linear issue with correct expert assignment
5. **RESUME** only after proper expert assignment confirmed

## Step 5: Scope and Expert Alignment
- [ ] Does work align with expert's core competencies?
- [ ] Is work within approved F1-F6 MVP scope?
- [ ] Does expert have capacity for quality delivery?
- [ ] Are success criteria clear and achievable?

**NEVER PROCEED** without proper expert assignment validation.
```

## üîÑ Expert Coordination Automation

### Cross-Expert Dependency Management
```typescript
const EXPERT_COORDINATION = {
  database_frontend: {
    scenario: "Frontend needs database schema changes",
    experts: ["Morgan Smith (Database)", "Alex Thompson (Lead Dev)"],
    coordination: "Database Architect designs schema, Lead Developer implements frontend",
    handoff: "Schema design complete ‚Üí Frontend implementation begins"
  },
  
  ai_ux_design: {
    scenario: "AI features need executive-friendly UX",
    experts: ["Dr. Priya Patel (AI)", "Maya Rodriguez (UX)", "David Chen (Design)"],
    coordination: "AI Architect defines functionality, UX Expert designs workflow, Visual Designer creates interface",
    handoff: "AI requirements ‚Üí UX design ‚Üí Visual implementation"
  },
  
  executive_business_technical: {
    scenario: "Executive features with business logic and technical implementation",
    experts: ["Sarah Chen (Product)", "Marcus Rodriguez (Strategic)", "Alex Thompson (Lead Dev)"],
    coordination: "Product Manager validates scope, Strategic Consultant defines business logic, Lead Developer implements",
    handoff: "Business requirements ‚Üí Technical specification ‚Üí Implementation"
  },
  
  infrastructure_deployment: {
    scenario: "Platform configuration and deployment",
    experts: ["Jordan Kim (Vercel)", "Taylor Morgan (GitHub)", "Alex Thompson (Lead Dev)"],
    coordination: "GitHub Expert configures CI/CD, Vercel Engineer optimizes platform, Lead Developer validates deployment",
    handoff: "CI/CD setup ‚Üí Platform optimization ‚Üí Deployment validation"
  }
};
```

### Expert Workload Monitoring
```typescript
const WORKLOAD_MONITORING = {
  capacity_tracking: {
    database_architect: {
      max_concurrent: 2, // Schema changes and complex queries
      current_load: "Monitor via Linear issue assignments",
      availability: "Flag when approaching capacity limit"
    },
    ai_architect: {
      max_concurrent: 3, // AI feature development and review
      current_load: "Track AI feature development pipeline",
      availability: "Ensure availability for AI feature reviews"
    },
    lead_developer: {
      max_concurrent: 4, // Primary development work coordination
      current_load: "Monitor development velocity and quality",
      availability: "Balance implementation and review responsibilities"
    }
  },
  
  escalation_triggers: {
    overload_detection: "Expert assigned >max_concurrent work items",
    quality_impact: "Expert rushed due to overload affecting quality",
    timeline_risk: "Expert unavailability risking sprint delivery",
    coordination_bottleneck: "Expert delay blocking other experts"
  }
};
```
