## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### 1. Configuration Activation
The `.cursorrules` file is automatically active in this workspace. All Cursor AI interactions will follow these rules.

### 2. Start with Master Prompt
**Always begin with the master prompt for ANY development task:**
```
@master-prompt    # USE THIS FIRST - Routes to appropriate expert and template
```

### 3. Intelligent Routing System
The system automatically:
1. **Analyzes your task** for scope, complexity, and work type
2. **Validates against F1-F6 scope** and prevents scope creep
3. **Assigns appropriate expert** based on work requirements
4. **Routes to specialized template** for detailed implementation
5. **Sets up quality gates** and success criteria

### 4. Specialized Templates (Auto-Selected)
```
@feature-implementation    # General feature development
@ai-feature-development   # AI features (requires AI Architect)
@database-development     # Database work (requires Database Architect)
@expert-assignment        # Expert assignment validation
@background-monitoring    # Continuous quality monitoring
@intelligent-task-router  # Advanced task analysis and routing
```

### 5. Development Workflow
1. **Start with Master Prompt**: Use @master-prompt for all tasks
2. **Follow Router Guidance**: Let the intelligent router analyze and assign
3. **Use Assigned Template**: Follow the specialized template provided
4. **Complete Quality Gates**: Meet all performance, accessibility, security standards
5. **Expert Review Required**: Mandatory expert review before merge
