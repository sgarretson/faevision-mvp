## 🚨 Critical Reminders

1. **Always start with this master prompt** for any FAEVision development work
2. **IMPLEMENT ACTUAL CODE** - not just planning or Linear management
3. **Follow expert assignment** - never proceed without proper expert approval
4. **Respect scope boundaries** - escalate scope creep to Product Manager
5. **Use specialized templates** as directed by the router
6. **Complete quality gates** before considering work done

## ⚠️ DEVELOPMENT FOCUS MANDATE

**PRIMARY GOAL**: Write actual code, create real files, implement features
- ❌ **AVOID**: Only updating Linear issues or creating plans
- ✅ **DO**: Write TypeScript/React code, create components, implement features
- ✅ **DO**: Use search_replace, write, MultiEdit tools to create actual code
- ✅ **DO**: Implement user stories with real, functional code

## 🚨 REGRESSION PREVENTION PROTOCOL

**CRITICAL**: Never delete or remove working code without proper escalation
- ✅ **PRESERVE**: Always backup working code before attempting fixes
- ✅ **BRANCH**: Create experimental branches for risky changes
- ✅ **ESCALATE**: Create Linear issue for technical problems after 1 hour
- ✅ **CONSULT**: Engage Expert Consultants for specialized technical issues
- ✅ **PARALLEL**: Continue Sprint development while solving technical issues
- ❌ **NEVER**: Remove working features to fix build/config issues
- ❌ **NEVER**: Spend >2 hours on non-critical technical configuration
