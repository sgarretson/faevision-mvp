🎯 Linear MCP Integration Setup - Alex Johnson's Analysis
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

FAEVision MVP - Enhanced AI-Linear Integration Strategy
Expert: Alex Johnson (Linear Expert)

📊 MCP INTEGRATION ASSESSMENT
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ STRONG RECOMMENDATION: IMPLEMENT LINEAR MCP

Why this enhances our FAEVision MVP development:

🚀 DEVELOPMENT EFFICIENCY GAINS:
- Direct Cursor-Linear integration for issue management
- AI-assisted project tracking and coordination  
- Automated issue creation during development
- Streamlined expert handoffs and progress tracking

💡 AI-ENHANCED WORKFLOW BENEFITS:
- Claude can directly access Linear project status
- Cursor can create/update issues during code development
- Real-time synchronization between AI tools and project management
- Reduced context switching between tools

🎯 11-WEEK DELIVERY ACCELERATION:
- Eliminates manual Linear task management overhead
- Improves cross-expert coordination efficiency
- Enables AI-assisted epic and sprint planning
- Provides intelligent project insights and recommendations

🔧 CURSOR INTEGRATION SETUP (Primary Priority)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Step 1: Install Linear MCP in Cursor
From the Linear MCP documentation, Cursor has native support.

Install directly from: Cursor's MCP tools page
Or configure manually in Cursor settings

Step 2: Configuration Details
- Transport: Server-Sent Events (SSE) 
- Endpoint: https://mcp.linear.app/sse
- Authentication: OAuth 2.1 with dynamic client registration
- Tools Available: Issue creation, project management, comments
